# Methodology

## Attribution

### Rationale and history
ICF reporting requires adjusting results for attribution - enabling HMG to claim a share of results. 
* Original modifiers were decided in 2014 and are equal to the share of public investment by HMG in CF and ACP. 
* Methodological guidane from the International Climate Fund (ICF) calls for projects to attribute at the point closest to production of results. 
* HMG issued guidance across all ICF programs to seek to attribute at the lowest level possible, but recognizing the complexitity that this may entail, it was reccomended that programs attribute at the level of HMG investment.

### Sub-fund attribution approach
* The M&E providers developed a methodology and collected data to apply sub-fund level attribution to CP3 results, providing a more direct attribution approach. 
* This approach maintians the same logic where reuslts are attributed proportionally by investment amount. Applying a sub-fund attribution methodology allowed the M&E team to identify leaders and laggards at the fund level, e.g. some funds contribute more to GHG emissions reductions than others due to the makeup of their portfolios.

* A key consideration was that a large number of public finance providers are participating in private equity sub-funds. This was a key factor driving down attributed results when the methodology was implemented. Only public investors that report climate finance to OECD are counted in the attribution calculation. In other, words, HMG splits results only with public climate finance donors and not with all other public investors. This reduces the risk of double-counting results. 

However, assigining attribution ex-post is fraught with challenges. Wherever possible, it is preferable for attribution approaches to be discussed and decided upon by impact investors in advance as part of the due diligence and negotiation phase of projects. 


## Additionality

### Rationale and history
ICF reporting requires adjusting results for additionality. This is done by applying an additionality modifier to KPI results. 
* Original modifiers were set through economic modeling at the inception of CP3 and before investments were made. These are applied to results. 
* However, HMG recognized that a more robust approach was needed and asked the M&E provider to consider new approaches. 

### Additionality approach
The additionality approach uses the investment environment in a country as the sole indicator of additionality in the portfolio. This approach is complementary to in-depth case study assessments of additionality that are also part of the ongoing evaluation of CP3.

Data is based on the Venutre Capital & Private Equity Country Attractiveness (VCPE) Index created by IESE Business School and published annually. The index is a very strong indicator of the likelihood of private equity investment in a given country. 
The VCPE Index rates countries from 0 (weak investment environment) to 100 (strong investment environment). In turn, additionality scores are assigned as follows:
```
* Scores below 45 = 100% additional investment
* Scores above 75 = 0% additional investment
* Scores between 45 and 75 = ((75 - Country score)/30) additional investment
```

**We define an additional investment as one that is not likely under a BAU scenario. Therefore, investment in countries with low VCPE indicate a higher likelihood of additionality. **

**Advantages of this approach:**
* Standarized, objective, and time efficient calculation of additionality based on a robust country attractiveness ranking. 
* We have observed the same relationship between a country additionality score and the likelihood of private investment as what has been shown in published research.

* Climatescope and VCPE both show that the domestic enabling environment is the main driver unlocking private finance, even when incorporating sector-specific factors

**Limitations of this approach:** 
* This approach considers the country of investment as the sole factor for determining additionalty. Country investment environment is a strong factor but not the only relevant one. 
* The sector of investment is also relevant. However, we have not found a suitable method to crate a score for sectoral additionality. This is complicated by the wide variety of sectors in the portfolios. 
* The investment funds do not have a mandate for maximizing additionality and therefore any assesment is decoupled from the ultimate drivers of results (investment decisions).
* Due to current fund reporitng (funds provided aggregate results), we have not been able to apply additionality at the project level for non-financial KPIs. Additionality is applied at the project level for financial KPIs (KPI 11 and 12). 
* We use a weighted average additionality modifier based on investment amounts per country to derive a methodology for all non-financial KPIs in each of the main funds (CF and ACP)
