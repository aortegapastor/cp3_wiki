## Structure and reporting chain
The UK Department for International Development (DFID) and the Department for Energy and Climate Change (DECC) invested £110m million in two commercial private equity funds: the Catalyst Fund (CF) managed by the International Finance Corporation (IFC) and the Asia Climate Partners (ACP) fund managed by Robeco, Orix and the Asian Development Bank (AsDB).
* CF is a Fund-of-Funds, investing mainly in secondary funds run by private fund managers which in turn make investments in projects and companies. CF will invest approximately 80% of its assets through secondary funds.
* ACP on the other hand, will mostly invest directly and only 20% of its investments are expected to be through secondary funds.
* CP3 also has a £20m technical assistance facility. CP3 has a multi-layered structure and reporting chain:
