# Background

## What is the CP3 program?
The Climate Public Private Partnership (CP3) is a joint Foreign Commonwealth and Development Office (FCDO) and Department of Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy (BEIS) initiative. CP3 is a £130m programme that utilises an innovative approach to deliver UK ODA. To mobilise private finance at scale, CP3 is participating as an equity investor in two private equity (PE) funds. CP3 invested £50m as an anchor investor in the International Finance Corporation’s (IFC) Catalyst Fund (CF), a fund-of-funds managed by the IFC Asset Management Company (AMC), and £60m (US$100m) in Asia Climate Partners (ACP), a fund managed through a partnership between ADB, Orix and Robeco. In addition to the investments in the PE funds, the UK government also made available £19m to a technical assistance facility (TA) to support the market and undertake enabling activities for PE, policy and regulatory initiatives and support schemes for first-time fund managers. 

## Structure and reporting chain
The UK Department for International Development (DFID) and the  Department of Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy (BEIS) (formerly, Department for Energy and Climate Change, DECC) invested £110m million in two commercial private equity funds: the Catalyst Fund (CF) managed by the International Finance Corporation (IFC) and the Asia Climate Partners (ACP) fund managed by Robeco, Orix and the Asian Development Bank (AsDB).
* CF is a Fund-of-Funds, investing mainly in secondary funds run by private fund managers which in turn make investments in projects and companies. CF will invest approximately 80% of its assets through secondary funds.
* ACP on the other hand, will mostly invest directly and only 20% of its investments are expected to be through secondary funds.
* CP3 also has a £20m technical assistance facility. Most of this support (£11m) was provided to the **Seed Capital Assistance Facility Phase II (SCAF).** 
  *  SCAF I began in 2009 and ran for five years, supporting eight partners with financing from UN Environment and ADB, among others. Under CP3, DFID invested in SCAF Phase II which is set to run for eight years, starting in 2014. Phase II operates in a similar manner to Phase I with two significant  differences: Phase II has expanded their prospective partner base to include DevCos in order to more effectively support pipeline development; and now offer a repayable loan under their second support line with shared development risks, rather than a straight grant. SCAF now provides support to 15 partners, including 4 agreements with new fund managers in the low-carbon space during the fundraising stage.
  *  In 2013, the UK government initially committed £9m to the Facility.  Following the recommendations to scale up the project in the 2018 mid-term evaluation of SCAF, the UK government committed an initial £2m to SCAF in 2019.  
  *  Two other TA programmes (ICF TA and Mercer Strategy Allocation) were supported early on in the CP3 investment and closed by 2015. These are generally not included in the program evaluation.
  *  SCAF also receives funding from BMUB (the German Federal Ministry for the Environment, Nature Conservation, Building and Nuclear Safety). BMUB have also increased their commitment to SCAF in response to recommendations from the 2018 mid-term evaluation. It is delivered through the United Nations Environment Programme (UN Environment) supported by the United Nations Office for Operations (UNOPS) and two entities of the Frankfurt School group , the Frankfurt School of Finance and Management GmbH (FS), UN Environment Collaborating Centre for Climate and Sustainable Energy Finance, and the Frankfurt School Financial Services.  

CP3 has a multi-layered structure and reporting chain:

## CPI's role
Integrity Global, Climate Policy Initiative (CPI) and NIRAS-LTS International (NIRAS-LTS) have been contracted as the CP3 Phase II M&E agents. 

The purpose of the Monitoring and Evaluation (M&E) assignment is to provide a rigorous and independent assessment of the relevance, coherence, effectiveness, efficiency, impact and sustainability of the programme in catalysing the role of the private sector finance in driving low carbon, climate resilient  (LCCR) growth in developing countries. 
The evaluation has a dual function, supporting both accountability and learning. This evaluation should also feed into the larger evaluation process of the ICF, helping the UK Government understand how CP3 contributes towards achieving the objectives of the ICF and capturing lessons that can be disseminated across programmes, as well as providing private sector actors with insight into how HMG has sought to influence low-carbon climate resilient markets.
