## Inputs
### Data inputs
Financial data: Catalyst Fund and ACP quarterly reports, fund manager letters, and project-level data from the Catalyst Fund’s sub-funds.
Non-financial data: IFC DOTS reports, ACP impact reporting, SCAF reporting, fund manager interviews, and secondary research.
The Catalyst Fund uses the IFC Development Outcome Tracking System (DOTS) for development outcome and results reporting. DOTS is used by IFC to measure the development effectiveness of their investment and advisory work and collects data on four performance categories: financial performance, economic performance, environmental and social performance and private sector development.

## Outputs
### Key Performance Indicators (KPIs)

#### KPI 5: Number of direct jobs created (#)
This indicator measures the absolute number of direct jobs created. We apply an attribution adjustment for pro rata share of public funding as per all KPIs. The **Catalyst Fund** measures the total number of direct employees in the investment company at the end of each fiscal year as well as changes from year to year:
* Total employment (Jobs provided)
* New employees since last year The number of new employees is determined based on an annual survey of the number of employees within investee companies.

**Asia Climate Partners (ACP)** reports “net jobs” that discounts for job losses and is a more stringent assumption than what is required from the ICF.
* Direct Net Jobs Created.
ACP aims to implement a methodology that incorporates attribution of their role in creating a job. In addition, their methodology will be inclusive of job losses related to the ACP project. Overall, these differences are expected to decrease the number of jobs reported in comparison to projects that do not discount these factors.

#### KPI 6: Net changes in Greenhouse Gas Emissions (tCO2e)
The indicator reports on the net change in greenhouse gas emissions from the intervention measured in tonnes of carbon dioxide equivalent (tCO2e) and reported in yearly savings, estimated relative to the assumed business as usual emission trajectory (referring to the ‘Kyoto basket’ definition of greenhouse gas emissions). Hence this reports the absolute volume of greenhouse gas emissions reduced or avoided (tCO2e). 
The **Catalyst Fund** and **ACP** both measure Metric Tons of CO2e avoided (tCO2e). 
*We apply an attribution adjustment for pro rata share of public funding as per all KPIs.*

#### KPI 7: Level of installed capacity (MW)
KPI 7 measures the increased clean energy capacity resulting from ICF funding. Installed capacity is the rated power output of electrical power (MWe) or thermal power (MWt) in operation. Attribution adjustments are applied by CPI.  
Clean energy is low and zero carbon energy generation. Sources include but are not limited to: wind power, solar, fuel cells, tidal systems, hydropower, Carbon Capture & Storage (CCS), second generation biofuels, gasification technologies, clean cook stoves, biomass and boilers and kilns for process heating/dying. Nuclear is not included.  Installed capacity must be reported by **CF** and **ACP** as an annual cumulative total and disaggregated by whether the installed capacity is grid-connected or off-grid and installed in urban or rural areas where possible.

*We apply an attribution adjustment for pro rata share of public funding as per all KPIs.*

#### KPI 11: Volume of public finance mobilized for climate change (USD)
KPI 11 measures the volume of finance from public (i.e. government) sources outside of the UK. This could include finance from other donors and partner governments, UN Agencies, development banks and others. 
Both **CF** and **ACP** report on USD$ Legally Committed. Foreign exchange conversion is applied separately. Counts all funds that are invested by public entities in the Catalyst Fund and its sub-funds. No explicit additionality determination. This is made by CPI.

*Pro-rata attribution adjustments are applied by CPI. The current attribution adjustment does not consider other public donors downstream of the Catalyst Fund.*

#### KPI 12: Volume of private finance mobilized for climate change (USD)
KPI 12 measures the volume of finance mobilised from non-public sources such as commercial banks, private companies, private or company pension funds, NGO money, CDM financing, voluntary carbon credit market, insurance companies, private savings, family money, entrepreneurs’ own capital and sovereign wealth funds. It includes all types such as equity, debt and guarantees. Private finance can be from developed and developing country institutions and is reported in a disaggregated manner. 
Both **CF** and **ACP** report on USD$ Legally Committed. Foreign exchange conversion is applied separately. Counts all funds that are invested by non-public entities in the Catalyst Fund and its sub-funds. No explicit additionality determination. This is made by CPI.

*Attribution adjustments considering the pro-rata share of funding are applied by CPI. No adjustment will be made on the riskiness of the investments for data reporting although this will be considered as part of the overall narrative of mobilisation of finance and transformational change.*
