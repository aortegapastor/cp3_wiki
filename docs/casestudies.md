# Case Studies

## Goals of the case studies

Case studies are undertaken as part of the CP3 M&E assignment, with evidence collected through case studies feeding into the overall evaluation. 
The main objectives of the case studies are to collect evidence to:
* Test the Theory of Change (ToC) and the validity of its most important assumptions;
* Seek a greater understanding of factors that cannot be measured through logical framework (log frame) indicators;
* Explore causality between inputs, outputs and impacts; and
* Provide additional assurance to the evaluation.

The approach to undertaking the case studies has been outlined in the Phase II Inception Report that has been approved by both BEIS and FCDO.  

## Scope

Each case study provides an opportunity to dive deeper into the financial structure, the mechanisms for the delivery of development benefits, application of safeguards and assurance of results.  Evidence from these assessments is then used to test the ToC by looking at the chain of causality from UK Government investment to climate and development outputs and outcomes. The following topics are assessed during the individual case studies:
* Availability and quality of monitoring data
* Development benefits and ESG safeguard application
* Achievement of financial additionality and financial leverage
* Contribution to the CP3 Programme ToC

## Investment-level case studies
### Sampling process
The investments chosen for the case studies are sampled against the criteria provided in the Inception Report to ensure that the selected cases are representative of the portfolio.

## Thematic case studies

In addition to the investment level studies noted in the sampling table above, thematic case studies have been conducted throughout both phases of the CP3 programme, covering cross-cutting topics of interest. The thematic studies selected to date are:
* A methodology for assessing investment additionality;
* Financial leverage across the portfolio; 
* The closure of the ACP Fund; and
* An assessment of private equity as a development finance vehicle.
