# CF and ACP Internal Reporting Processes

## Overview
CP3 invests its funds through two high level funds (CF and ACP) which are required contractually to report development and climate indicators. These funds, in turn, require the same from their investees.

## IFC Catalyst Fund
The Catalyst Fund uses the **IFC Development Outcome Tracking System (DOTS)** for development outcome and results reporting. DOTS is used by IFC to measure the development effectiveness of their investment and advisory work and collects data on four performance categories: financial performance, economic performance, environmental and social performance and private sector development.

As part of investment agreements, investee sub-funds and their investee companies are required to undertake periodic DOTS reporting. Investees report DOTS indicators on an annual basis using a standardized template. If needed, IFC DOTS specialists can provide support to investees to undertake reporting. Once this is complete, the templates are compiled by the IFC and an annual report is provided to CF investors, including CP3. There is annual external third-party assurance of IFC internal financial and sustainability reports by an accountancy firm. However, much of the DOTS data is self-reported and not externally verified.

## Asia Climate Partners
ACP adopted the Asian Development Bank (ADB) development impact monitoring tools (principally its ‘Design and Monitoring Framework’) as its approach for tracking results from ACP projects.

ACP monitors several key development impact measures, such as: employment statistics, including net jobs created, gender equality, and skills upgrading; greenhouse gas emission reductions (tCO2-equivalent per year) as a result of cleaner technologies; megawatt-hours of clean energy generation and capital mobilized and invested, including type and origin of investors.
